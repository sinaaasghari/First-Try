# First-Try

This project focuses on analyzing and processing household income and expenditure data using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The data utilized for this project is sourced from the Iranian Statistical Center and covers different aspects of household characteristics and expenditures.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

### 1. Data Collection

The data is collected from the Iranian Statistical Center's survey on household income and expenditures. The dataset includes various segments such as:

- **Household Characteristics:** Information about household members, their demographics, and social attributes.
- **Housing Characteristics:** Details about the type of housing, ownership status, and available facilities.
- **Expenditure on Food and Tobacco:** Information about household expenditures on food items and tobacco.
- **Expenditure on Beverages:** Details about the household expenditures on beverages.
- **Other Expenditures:** Information on expenditures on non-food items.
- **Housing Expenditures:** Details on housing-related expenditures.
- **Other Costs:** Includes miscellaneous household costs.
- **Household Income:** Information on the sources and amounts of household income.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing involves several steps:

- **Data Cleaning:** Removing or imputing missing values and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
- **Data Transformation:** Converting data into a suitable format for analysis, including normalization and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that may help improve the performance of the models.

### 3. Data Analysis

Various statistical methods are used to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data. This includes:

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Analyzing the basic features of the data through summaries and visualizations.
- **Trend Analysis:** Examining trends in household expenditures over different periods.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identifying relationships between different variables.

### 4. Machine Learning

Machine learning models are employed to make predictions and gain insights from the data. This includes:

- **Regression Analysis:** Predicting continuous outcomes such as total household income or expenditures.
- **Classification Analysis:** Classifying households into different categories based on their characteristics and expenditure patterns.

### 5. Results and Visualization

The results from the data analysis and machine learning models are visualized to provide clear and interpretable insights. This includes charts, graphs, and other visual aids.
